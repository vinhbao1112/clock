# Popcorn Shop Management System

This repository contains a simple example project showing how you might build
a popcorn shop management system using a Vue front‑end and a Laravel back‑end.

The project includes:

- `frontend/` – Minimal Vue code displaying a menu of items. Clicking an item
  shows a popup with links to various food delivery services.
- `backend/` – Example Laravel routes implementing skeleton authentication and
  order management endpoints.

These files are only a starting point and are not a complete application.
You can expand them to implement full functionality such as user roles,
order processing, and statistics.
